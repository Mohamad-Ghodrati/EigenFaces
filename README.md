# Eigenfaces

The notebook demonstrates two applications of Eigenfaces: facial recognition and image compression. Eigenfaces utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract the most salient features from a dataset of facial images.

# Facial Recognition

By projecting new faces onto the subspace spanned by the extracted eigenfaces, we can effectively compare them to known faces and establish matches or non-matches.

# Image Compression

Eigenfaces can also be leveraged for image compression. By representing images using a smaller set of eigenfaces and corresponding coefficients, we can significantly reduce the storage requirements while preserving essential facial features.
